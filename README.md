# Ice Factory Outfitters Site Navigation 

## Home Screen 
- The home screen holds all of our product categories with clickable icons which redirect a user to each individual product category page.  
- At the top of the page, there is a zamboni icon in the top right which will redirect the user to the cart, a login/register link for exisintg users to login and new users to register, and the Ice Factory logo in the top left will redirect users back to the home page. 

## Products 
- Products are combined based on their category. 
- Users can view all products offered by category, view the image, name, and price of the product as well as click a "more info" button in order to see an idividual product. 

## Single Product 
- Users can then read a short description of the product, add quantity desired and add the product to their cart.

- The cart can then be populated with various products and the quanities can be changed which will dynamically update the cart's total price. 
- Users can then checkout, enter their payment information and be given a prommpt upon successful order completion.
